# One Day

In this project, I built "One Day" - a bucket-list manager. One of the best ways to get things done is to write them down. With "One Day", you can list the adventures you want to do before the last good-bye and flag them out when there are done. "One Day" has a responsive layout (see GIF below) and renders well on computers, tablets and mobiles. It has been deployed to Heroku.

The adventures and things entered by the user are stored in a **mySQL database using JawsDB**. The data are thus persistent and will be displayed on the app as long as they aren't deleted from the database itself. 

The GitHub Repo for "One Day" can be accessed by clicking on "GitHub Repo Link", at the bottom the page.
